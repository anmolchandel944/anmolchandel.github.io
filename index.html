            <p>
                <strong>
                    Hey there! I’m Anmol — a creative technologist driven by curiosity, imagination, and a deep love for innovation. 💡
I don’t just explore technology; I bring it to life with a blend of logic, design, and storytelling.

With a strong command of C programming and algorithm design, I craft efficient, scalable solutions for complex challenges. I also design responsive, visually stunning websites using HTML, CSS, and modern UI principles. My growing expertise in AI isn’t limited to using tools — I strive to understand how artificial intelligence actually learns, thinks, and transforms real-world ideas into reality.

Beyond coding, I express creativity through professional PowerPoint presentations, photo & video editing, and impactful Canva designs that communicate ideas with clarity and emotion. I even run a YouTube channel where I share vlogs, tutorials, and insights that blend knowledge with creativity.
<br>
Lately, I’ve been diving deep into Japanese language learning, exploring its beauty and culture while sharpening my skills in Python, Java, and SQL. Whenever a new idea sparks, I love turning it into something tangible — fast. ⚡
<br>
At heart, I’m just a curious, creative mind who believes that every idea — no matter how weird or wild — deserves a chance to shine.
Let’s build something extraordinary together. 🚀

                    <p> <span> I’m </span>  currently writing a novel that begins in a way you might call ordinary — but trust me, it’s anything but that. It’s the story of an innocent boy whose kindness and simplicity become the reason for his pain. His friends betray him, his life falls apart… until one day, something unbelievable happens — he gets the chance to travel five years back in time.

At first, it may seem like a normal story, but as the pages unfold, everything changes. What starts as innocence slowly turns into darkness, revenge, and transformation.

The main character of my novel is “Shankh” — a boy who was once mocked for his innocence, but will one day become something no one ever imagined. This is not just a story… it’s a journey — into fate, choices, and the shadowed corners of the human mind.  </p>

These aren’t just ideas — they’re little sparks of madness mixed with creativity. Some may sound impossible today, but who knows? Maybe one of these “weird” ideas will shape tomorrow’s world.    “ Wait... could this actually work ? ”   .</p>
